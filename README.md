# Weapon-Detection-using-Yolo-Model-Deep-Learning-

The reason and motivation behind this work is to detect various weapons in real time, thus reducing the incidents. These incidents can be controlled using an early alarm system by alerting the operators and concerned authorities so that action can be taken immediately.
In most current surveillance systems, monitoring depends on the existence of a human element. This makes monitoring a very challenging task. In addition, it is labor-intensive and prone to errors.
These traditional systems have many problems such as weak security, low intelligence, high cost, and poor stability. Most of these systems are based on human operators. 
It is difficult for these operators to watch and analyze all the dangerous situations, especially with the long observation periods and many cameras. So, it is necessary to review our surveillance system again with the knowledge of new technology.
we should prepare and prevent the dangers and not repair and repent the wounds, One way to reduce this kind of violence is prevention via early detection so that the security agents or policemen can act. 
One innovative solution to this problem is to equip surveillance or control cameras with an accurate automatic weapon detection alert system.
